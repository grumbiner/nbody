# nbody

Simple n body module (astronomy.py and point_mass.py) and demonstration programs (solar_system.py and earth_system.py)

solar_system.py approximates the solar system with the Sun, Venus, Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn

earth_system.py is the earth plus N moons (of our moon's mass), 1 moon approximately in our moon's orbit, and the rest in random starting distances and speeds.
